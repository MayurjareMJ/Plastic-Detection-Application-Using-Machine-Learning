# Plastic-Detection-Application-Using-Machine-Learning
  This streamlit based App for detecting plastic.

>Overview:
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based application for detecting and classifying plastic objects in images. The  streamlit application utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to identify and categorize various types of plastic materials.

>Features:
 Image Classification: The application can classify images into different categories such as plastic bottles, containers, bags, etc.

Real-time Detection: Users can either upload images or use the application to capture real-time images for immediate analysis.

Accuracy: The model has been trained on a diverse dataset to ensure accurate identification of plastic materials.

Requirements:
Python 3.6
Yolo v5
OpenCV
Streamlit (for the web application)



Install the required packages using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
