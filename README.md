# Plastic-Detection-Application-Using-Machine-Learning
This streamlit based App for detecting plastic.

Overview:

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based application for detecting and classifying plastic objects in images.
The  streamlit application utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to identify and categorize various types of plastic materials.

Features:

-Detect plastic objects in images.
-Classify plastic objects into predefined categories.
-Provide bounding box coordinates for detected objects.
-Support for various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).


Requirements:

-Python 3.6
-Yolo v5
-OpenCV
-Streamlit (for the web application)
-NumPy
-Matplotlib


Install the required packages using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
