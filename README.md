# Plastic-Detection-Application-Using-Machine-Learning
This streamlit based App for detecting plastic.

# Overview:

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based application for detecting and classifying plastic objects in images.

The  streamlit application utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to identify and categorize various types of plastic materials.

# Features:

-Detect plastic objects in images.

-Classify plastic objects into predefined categories.

-Provide bounding box coordinates for detected objects.

-Support for various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).


# Requirements:

-Python 3.6

-Yolo v5

-OpenCV

-Streamlit (for the web application)

-NumPy

-Matplotlib


# Install the required packages using:

pip install -r requirements.txt
